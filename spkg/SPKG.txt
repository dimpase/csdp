== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

csdp is an autotool'ed version of CSDP,  
developed in its own repository at
https://github.org/dimpase/csdp. This is also where the spkg
metadata is tracked. To build a new spkg, use the spkg/make-spkg.sh
script in the repository.

To update to a new version, you need to bump the version number in
configure.ac and rerun autotools (autoreconf -fiv).

Note that the repository in the spkg is just a dummy to make Sage
happy, any changes should be merged to the upstream repo.
