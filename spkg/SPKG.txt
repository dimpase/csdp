== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

csdp is an autotool'ed version of CSDP,  
developed in its own repository at
https://github.org/dimpase/csdp. This is also where the spkg
metadata is tracked (in spkg/ subdirectory). To build a new spkg, 
use the spkg/make-spkg.sh script in the repository.

To update to a new version, you need to bump the version number in
configure.ac and rerun autotools (autoreconf -fiv).

Note that the repository in the spkg is just a dummy to make Sage
happy, any changes should be merged to the upstream repo.

The build is done with NOSHORTS variable defined; this makes it compatible
with packages, where NOSHORTS must be defined, e.g. 
https://github.com/dimpase/pycsdp; 
also the Sage Cython interface needs NOSHORTS defined.

Detailed steps to build the spkg are as follows:
 * clone the git repo
 * then 
     cd csdp/
     autoreconf --install 
     automake --add-missing --copy
 * start sage shell and run configure with right prefix there:
     sage -sh
     ./configure --prefix=$SAGE_LOCAL
 * finally, build the spkg:
     cd spkg/
     ./make-spkg.sh
 * then copy/use the resulting csdp-6.2.spkg
